This project compares two ways to build a Pokémon search tool—one with plain JavaScript and the other with React.js. 
Both versions let users enter a Pokémon name, fetch details from an API, and display the information. The main difference is how they handle updates and structure the code.

This version is simple and lightweight, using just three files: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML contains a form and a section to display Pokémon details, while JavaScript fetches the data and updates the page with innerHTML. There’s no setup required, making it easy to understand and quick to implement.

React takes a more organized approach. Instead of directly modifying HTML, it uses components to manage different parts of the UI. It also uses useState to keep track of data and update only what’s needed. While this makes the app more efficient and scalable, it does require more files and some familiarity with JavaScript frameworks.
